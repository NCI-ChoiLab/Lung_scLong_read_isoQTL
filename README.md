# Single-cell long-read RNA sequencing of human lung tissues

This repo includes the code to analyze the single-cell long-read dataset of lung tissues as part of manuscript "Single-cell full-length transcriptome of human lung reveals genetic effects on isoform regulation beyond gene-level expression".

The findings (i.e., isoform structure, isoform expression across lung cell types, and isoQTLs) in our paper could also be found and visulized via [ISOLUTION](https://appshare.cancer.gov/ISOLUTION)

## data
The raw data coule be downloaded on GEO accession number ().
The genotype data used for isoQTL mapping could be found on dbGap under accession: phs004420.
In the data folder, the GTF file for post-QC isoforms identified by long-read sequencing is provided. 
In mass-spec folder, the mass-spec summaries from 4 individuals are included.
